*** Thanks Chris for everything you have done in your time in Demography. Helping to refresh the models, helping us test the code, new R packages etc. The mobility report you produced to help us monitor Covid-19 impact has been really well used. And I’ve really valued your contribution to DPA team meetings – most recently with our consideration of diversity issues but other things too. Good luck in your new post and I hope you make it to Zurich at some point soon.***
