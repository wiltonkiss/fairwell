Chris,

All the best in your new Zurich role and hope you manage to actually get out there sometime.

Will miss those floral shirts brightening up the office...I was a big fan.

Expect to see you in the Market Porter for Xmas drinks of course...that's a contractual obligation for all leavers of course.

take care fella!

Al
