Chris

It's been genuine a pleasure having you in the team.  With your intelligence, humour, and slightly haphazard style - you fitted right in.
I hope that life in Zurich and the new job are as great as they sound and that you'll maybe put in a good word for me?
Keep in touch and keep contributing to our repos.

All the best

Ben
